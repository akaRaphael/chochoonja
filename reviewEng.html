              Choon-ja Cho depicts only female nudes. The presence of the naked male body is excluded and other beings are alsoeliminated from her canvas. The background is soaked in colors yet separated by meaningless traces. Her paintings exclusively show a woman's body. The assurance about a woman's body enables the differentiation, separation, and exclusion to be conceivable.The artist believes that a woman's body is more beautiful than any other object, and that beauty comes from the lines which consist of the body. Thus, she has been developing her paintings with female bodies for nearly 30 years and wanted to implement theexquisite beauty of neckline, shoulders, and bust line on her canvas. In order for her to emphasize the lines nudity was inevitable and models' hair also had to be tied up to show such lines. Her paintings tend to consistently reveal the lines of the jaw,neck, shoulder and breast. In addition, it has the pure and innocent femininity exude from the scene in a tacit way. So, the viewers should pay attention to the lines of the body rather than the body itself. The human body consists of a myriad of lines. The lines that are gently and lusciously connected appear and stay as if they continue to fade in and out among the bones, muscles, flesh, and wrinkles. They are not artificial, but natural.

              In Cho's paintings, the delicate lines, which vary in thickness and strength, get tense connecting and disconnecting one another. While based on precise anatomy, she unveils the line's distinctive taste of its own, which represents conciseness of oriental painting. After all, Cho's pictures can be recognized by an endeavor to discover and embody the delicate, voluptuous, and extremely beautiful lines of a human body, especially a woman's body. Female nudes would have been unavoidable to complete such a line. The artist must be convinced that the beauty of a woman's body originates from the lines that comprise the body. If oriental painting is nothing but the beauty of lines, Choon-ja Cho's pictures draw 'lines' by means of elaborate colored picture based on accurate figure drawing. Drawing that one proper line may be a method of oriental painting.

              The artist also clothes the models with sheer gowns to enrich the composition and interject a story as a consideration to escape the monotony of repeated female body. In actuality, it is a bit strange to recognize it as clothing. Itmerely contours the lower ends of clothes, like a piece of cloth. It is not to cover up the body or indicate identity but to accentuate and boost body contours with efficiency. Further, such veils are intended to spread the bodylines connected to the outside of the body. The lines pertain to direction and energy, flow and movement, and a psychological language. The clothes partially cover the exposure yet unveil the body clearly, display the body lines, and synchronize with static and sedate body draped invitality, mobility and flow. That is such traces playing and placed between presence and absence. Floaty and filmy clothes associated with direction of visage look slowly swayed by the wind. It designates temporality on still canvas and sensibility lingers gradually. Certain wavelengths are formed on canvas with liveliness, and a sort of voyeurism is secretly aroused. Though creating these scenes seems to be rather contrived, it is perhaps planned by Cho whose intent to visualize the engaging body lines full of life and unique flavor of line drawing through traditional colored picture using mineral pigments.

              As for the artist, art work is a realization of beauty postulated by herself and actualization of her aesthetic world. Mimicking beauty becomes the basis of her paintings. She finds ideal and perfection from a woman's body. That is her aesthetics and philosophy. Cho imitates and represents female bodies, and ultimately, pursues the lines consisting of the body and prioritizes the exposition on canvas. It is not a record of personalization but sharing exquisiteness of the lines. Not the lines can only be effective by the four gracious plants, calligraphy, or abstract brush strokes but the nudecolored picture can also evoke the possibility.

              Thus, the body of a woman is the matter, subject, and almost everything else to the artist and her works. A woman's body is beautiful to her more than anything else. It seems like the confidence which enables her, as a woman herself, to grasp and reify feminine beautythoroughly. It can be clearly found in her canvas as something different from the beauty of the same body of a woman interpreted by male artists. Therefore, the picture is the art of lines, originated from female body, which a female discovered. To draw the line, today, Cho is looking for it in front of a naked woman. She is constantly tracing the beauty, flow of zest, and strength.
